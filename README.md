# botium-mocha-sample
A project created for testing a Bot application created using Dialogflow from Google, using Mocha and Botium.

Mocha is used as the test runner on this project;

Botium is used as the ChatBot tests specification and runs it on Mocha.

For running the tests, one should do:

```npm test```

The Botium configurations were settled up for being used with environment variables, if you want to run this project with your personal Dialogflow bot, then you should create a new bot project with the Small-Talk samples, and use the project configurations on the botium.json configuration file.

This is a simple project, created mainly for having a first impression on Botium used along with another Test Runner.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me :-)
